change skybox
figure out how to put a weapon in the players hand
make the sounds 3d (foot steps should sound like they're coming from the players feet)
make an NPC to have dialogue with
get prison assets (jail cell door/ bars)
make a landscape
make a light switch


Ideas-----
The game could begin with a black screen with white text that fades in
"where am I? how did I get here?"
the game fades in, we are in a prison cell, the player has a few moments to walk around and explore the cell
an NPC walks up to the cell and makes a noise to get our attention,
the player can walk up and talk to the npc.
